## What It Does

-  Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
-  Switch between **Light** and **Dark Mode** with a single click
-  Prevents invalid entries with smart input validation
-  Refresh the form instantly with a reset button

## Why I Made This

This project was built as a fun and educational way to explore Python's GUI capabilities using Tkinter. It helped me understand event handling, user input validation, and how to make user-friendly desktop apps.

##  What's Next

Some fun ideas for the future:
- Export conversion history
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Package it as an `.exe` app for easy sharing
- Maybe even a web version?
